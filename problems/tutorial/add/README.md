# A + B

First, make sure you're finished [setting up your workspace](https://github.com/DBarinovv/rust_2023_homework/blob/master/docs/setup.md).

## Task

In the file `src/lib.rs`, implement a function `add` that adds two integers.

## Friendly reminder

Tests to the problems are always located in the `tests/tests.rs` file. It's better to read them _before_ coding and asking questions.
